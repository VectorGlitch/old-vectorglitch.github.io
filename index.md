Hi there! My name's Juniper, but feel free to call me June. I am all bark. barkbarkbark! Talk to me about pictures of anthropomorphic animals, or about my writing, which I sometimes post to [my blog!](https://ju.niper.me/posts/){:target="_self"}

A couple of fun facts: All of my work are powered by my plushies, which are everywhere on my desk and in my bed. This website is powered by GitHub Pages. I am typing this with a custom keyboard, a CannonKeys Sagittarius! I play my fighting games with a Snackbox Micro.
