Hi There! My name's Erin (It/Its), but feel free to call me puppy. Talk to me about video games F1, silly animal stuff, and the fight for trans rights which I sometimes write about on  [my blog!](https://t4t.dog/posts/){:target="_self"}

A couple of fun facts:
I am trans and actively fight for trans liberation.
I am an actual real dog. Give me treats!
All of my work is powered by mega AuDHD.
